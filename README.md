# Community Toolkit Docs

This repo contains the [guidance documentation](https://aka.ms/toolkit/docs) for various [Community Toolkits](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit) that are part of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/).

This includes the following projects:

- .NET Community Toolkit (and MVVM Toolkit)
- .NET MAUI Community Toolkit
- Windows Community Toolkit (though our docs are still migrating from [the old repo here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs))
