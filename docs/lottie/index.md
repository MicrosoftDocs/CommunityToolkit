# Lottie Animations

Lottie-Windows enables beautiful Adobe AfterEffects animations in Windows applications. Using [BodyMovin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/) JSON files and the AnimatedVisualPlayer control, you can bring animations from the [Lottie community](https://lottiefiles.com/) into WinUI 2, WinUI 3, and UWP apps.

## Getting Started

Choose your workflow:

- **[Getting Started with JSON](getting-started-json.md)** - Load animations at runtime using LottieVisualSource
- **[Using Codegen](getting-started-codegen.md)** - Generate C# or C++ classes for better performance

See [JSON vs Codegen comparison](json-codegen.md) to understand the tradeoffs between approaches.

## Scenarios

Browse additional scenarios and techniques:

- [Asynchronous Play Method](async-play.md) - Coordinate animation sequences
- [Fallback Handling](fallback.md) - Handle unsupported AfterEffects features
- [Playback Controls](playback.md) - Control animation playback
- [Segments](segments.md) - Play specific animation segments
