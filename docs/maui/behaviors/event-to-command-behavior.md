# EventToCommandBehavior

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](../includes/preview-note.md)]

The `EventToCommandBehavior` is a `behavior` that allows the user to invoke a `Command` through an `Event`. It is designed to associate Commands to events exposed by controls that were not designed to support Commands. It allows you to map any arbitrary event on a control to a Command.

When using this `behavior` with selection or tap events exposed by `ListView` an additional converter is required. This converter converts the event arguments to a command parameter which is then passed onto the Command. They are also available in the Maui Community Toolkit:

* [ItemTappedEventArgsConverter](../converters/item-tapped-eventargs-converter.md)
* [SelectedItemEventArgsConverter](../converters/selected-item-eventargs-converter.md)

## Syntax

### XAML

The `EventToCommandBehavior` can be used as follows in XAML:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:toolkit="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2022/maui/toolkit"
             x:Class="MyLittleApp.MainPage">
    
    <Button>
        <Button.Behaviors>
            <toolkit:EventToCommandBehavior
                EventName="Clicked"
                Command="{Binding MyCustomCommand}" />
        </Button.Behaviors>
    </Button>
</ContentPage>
```

### C#

The `EventToCommandBehavior` can be used as follows in C#:

```csharp
class EventToCommandBehaviorPage : ContentPage
{
    public EventToCommandBehaviorPage()
    {
        var button = new Button();

        var behavior = new EventToCommandBehavior
        {
            EventName = nameof(Button.Clicked),
            Command = new MyCustomCommand()
        };

        button.Behaviors.Add(behavior);

        Content = entry;
    }
}
```

### C# Markup

Our [`CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup`](../markup/markup.md) package provides a much more concise way to use this behavior in C#.

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup;

class EventToCommandBehaviorPage : ContentPage
{
    public EventToCommandBehaviorPage()
    {
        Content = new Button()
        .Behaviors(new EventToCommandBehavior
        {
            EventName = nameof(Button.Clicked),
            Command = new MyCustomCommand()
        });                 
    }
}
```
