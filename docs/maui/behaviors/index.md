# Behaviors

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](../includes/preview-note.md)]

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) behaviors let you add functionality to user interface controls without having to subclass them. Instead, the functionality is implemented in a behavior class and attached to the control as if it was part of the control itself.

For further information on Behaviors please refer to the [.NET MAUI documentation](/dotnet/maui/fundamentals/behaviors).

## .NET MAUI Community Toolkit Behaviors
