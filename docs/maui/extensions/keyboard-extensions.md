# KeyboardExtensions

The `KeyboardExtensions` provide a series of extension methods that support interacting with the Keyboard on controls that support text input.

The `KeyboardExtensions` can be found under the `CommunityToolkit.Maui.Core.Extensions` namespace so just add the following line to get started:

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Core.Extensions;
```

## Soft Keyboard Methods

The following methods allow you to close, show, and check if the keyboard is open.

### Hide Keyboard

The `HideKeyboardAsync` method will hide the Soft Input Keyboard if it is currently visible

The following example shows how to hide the keyboard for a given entry:

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Extensions.Core;

entry.HideKeyboardAsync(CancellationToken.None);
```

### Show Keyboard

The `ShowKeyboardAsync` method will show the Soft Input Keyboard and indicates what control you are opening it for

The following example shows how to show the keyboard for a given entry:
```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Extensions.Core;

entry.ShowKeyboardAsync(CancellationToken.None);
```

### Is SoftKeyboard Showing

The `IsSoftKeyboardShowing` method indicates if the Soft Keyboard is currently open.

The following example shows how to check if the Soft Input Keyboard is currently open and showing:

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Extensions.Core;

entry.IsSoftKeyboardShowing()
```
