# BindableObject extensions

The `BindableObject` extensions provide a series of extension methods that support configuring `Binding`s on a `BindableObject`.

The extensions offer the following methods:

## Bind

The `Bind` method offers a number of overloads providing different convenience around the setup of a `Binding`. For further information of the possibilities of `Binding` data in a .NET MAUI application refer to the [Microsoft documentation](/dotnet/maui/fundamentals/data-binding/).

### Example

There are a number of overloads for the `Bind` method.

#### One way binding

A one way binding from a view model (`RegistrationViewModel`) property called `RegistrationCode` to the `Text` property of an `Label` can be created as follows:

```csharp
new Entry()
    .Bind(Label.TextProperty, 
            getter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm) => vm.RegistrationCode)
```

#### Two way binding

A two way binding from a view model (`RegistrationViewModel`) property called `RegistrationCode` to the `Text` property of an `Entry` can be created as follows:

```csharp
new Entry()
    .Bind(Entry.TextProperty,
            getter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm) => vm.RegistrationCode,
            setter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm, string code) => vm.RegistrationCode = code)
```

### Complex (Nested) Bindings

When binding to a property inside of a property (also known as "Nested Bindings"), the `handlers` parameter is required. The `handler` parameter requires a reference to each Property in the complex binding chain.

Along with the example below, you can find additonal examples of complex bindings in the [Unit Tests for `CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup`](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui.Markup/blob/08459a7e128de0e764f4e293cc191bfa293b79bd/src/CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup.UnitTests/TypedBindingExtensionsTests.cs#L308-L461).

#### Complex (Nested) Bindings Example

Using the below `ViewModel` class, we can create a nested two-way binding directly to `ViewModel.NestedObject.Text` using the `handlers` parameter:

```csharp
new Entry().Bind(
    Entry.TextProperty,
    getter: static (ViewModel vm) => vm.NestedObject.Text,
    handlers: 
    [
        (vm => vm, nameof(ViewModel.NestedObject)),
        (vm => vm.NestedObject, nameof(ViewModel.NestedObject.Text)),
    ],
    setter: static (ViewModel vm, string text) => vm.NestedObject.Text = text);
```

```cs
class ViewModel
{
    public NestedObject NestedObject { get; set; } = new();

    public required string Text { get; set; }
}

class NestedObject
{
    public required string Text { get; set; }
}
```

#### Default property

The `Bind` method can be called without specifying the property to set the binding up for, this will utilize the defaults provided by the library with the full list at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui.Markup/blob/523ff96160889f0806f7686e25c5d651fa7d8b7e/src/CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup/DefaultBindableProperties.cs).

The default property to bind for an `Entry` is the text property. So the above example could be written as:

```csharp
new Entry().Bind(nameof(ViewModel.RegistrationCode))
```

> [!WARNING]
> This approach will result in some level of Reflection being used and will not perform as well as the [Explicit property](#inline-conversion) approach.

#### Value conversion

The `Bind` method allows for a developer to supply the `Converter` that they wish to use in the binding or simply provide a mechanism to use an inline conversion.

##### Converter

```csharp
new Entry()
    .Bind(Entry.TextProperty,
            getter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm) => vm.RegistrationCode,
            converter: new TextCaseConverter { Type = TextCaseType.Upper });
```


See [`TextCaseConverter`](../../converters/text-case-converter.md) for the documentation on it's full usage.

##### Inline conversion

```csharp
new Entry()
    .Bind(Entry.TextProperty,
            getter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm) => vm.RegistrationCode,
            convert: (string? text) => text?.ToUpperInvariant());
```

#### Multiple Bindings

Multiple Bindings can be aggregated together leveraging the `IMultiValueConverter`.

The `convert` parameter is a `Func` that is required to convert the multiple bindings to the required result.

```csharp
new Label()
    .Bind(Label.TextProperty,
            binding1: new Binding(nameof(ViewModel.IsBusy)),
            binding2: new Binding(nameof(ViewModel.LabelText)),
            convert: ((bool IsBusy, string LabelText) values) => values.IsBusy ? string.Empty : values.LabelText)
```

## BindCommand

The `BindCommand` method provides a helpful way of configuring a binding to a default provided by the library with the full list at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui.Markup/blob/523ff96160889f0806f7686e25c5d651fa7d8b7e/src/CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup/DefaultBindableProperties.cs).

The default command to bind for an `Button` is the `Command` property. So the following example sets up a binding to that property.

```csharp
new Button().BindCommand(static (ViewModel vm) => vm.SubmitCommand);
```

The above could also be written as:

> [!NOTE]
> If the default command does not result in binding to your desired command then you can use the `Bind` method.

```csharp
new Button()
    .Bind(Entry.CommandProperty,
            getter: static (RegistrationViewModel vm) => vm.SubmitCommand,
            mode: BindingMode.OneTime);
```

## Gesture Binding

Gesture bindings allow us to create an `ClickGestureRecognizer`, `SwipeGestureRecognizer`, `TapGestureRecognizer`, attach it to any element that implements `IGestureRecognizer` and bind it to an `ICommand` in our ViewModel.

### BindClickGesture

The following example demonstrates how to create a `ClickGestureRecognizer` that requires `2` clicks to activate, attach it to a `Label` and bind it to an `ICommand` property called _ClickCommand_ in our ViewModel:

```cs
new Label()
    .BindClickGesture(
        static (ViewModel vm) => vm.ClickCommand,
        commandBindingMode: BindingMode.OneTime,
        numberOfClicksRequired: 2));
```

### BindSwipeGesture

The following example demonstrates how to create a `SwipeGestureRecognizer` that requires `SwipeDirection.Up` for its `SwipeDirection` and a minumum 200-point distance for its `Threshold`, then attach it to a `Label` and bind it to an `ICommand` property called _SwipeCommand_ in our ViewModel:

```cs
new Label()
    .BindSwipeGesture(
        static (ViewModel vm) => vm.SwipeCommand,
        commandBindingMode: BindingMode.OneTime,
        direction: SwipeDirection.Up,
        threshold: 200);
```

### BindTapGesture

The following example demonstrates how to create a `ClickGestureRecognizer` that requires `2` taps to activate, attach it to a `Label` and bind it to an `ICommand` property called _TapCommand_ in our ViewModel:

```cs
new Label()
    .BindTapGesture(
        static (ViewModel vm) => vm.TapCommand,
        commandBindingMode: BindingMode.OneTime,
        numberOfTapsRequired: 2));
```

## AppThemeBinding

The `AppThemeBinding` method allows for a light and dark value to assigned to a `BindableProperty` so that when the applications `AppTheme` is modified the appropriate value will be used for that theme.

The following example will assign the color black to the `Text` property of the `Label` control if the application is running in light theme and white in dark theme.

```csharp
new Label().AppThemeBinding(Label.TextColorProperty, Colors.Black, Colors.White);
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a more specific method when dealing with `Color` properties. `AppThemeColorBinding` will perform the same underlying behavior as `AppThemeBinding` but it requires a set of `Color` parameters.

For more information refer to the [Theming](../theming.md) documentation.
