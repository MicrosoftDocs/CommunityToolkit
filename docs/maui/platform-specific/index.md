# Platform specific features

The .NET MAUI Community Toolkit provides a set of platform specific features as can be seen in the list below:

| Feature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [`Android NavigationBar`](navigation-bar.md) | The `NavigationBar` provides the ability to customize the appearance of the Navigation Bar on the Android platform. |
| [`DialogFragment customization`](DialogFragment-customization.md) | The `DialogFragment` is Android's view used to show modal pages, and if you want to access its platform APIs and lifecycle this is the best place to hook into.
