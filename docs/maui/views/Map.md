# Map

The `Map` control is a cross-platform view for displaying and annotating maps. The Windows implementation is available through the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit.

## Setup

Before you are able to use `Map` inside your application you will need to install the NuGet package and add an initialization line in your *MauiProgram.cs*. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the [Get Started](../get-started.md) page.

## Examples

You can find examples of this control in action in the [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit Sample Application](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui/tree/main/samples/CommunityToolkit.Maui.Sample/Pages/Views/Maps).

## API

You can find the source code for `Map` over on the [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui/blob/main/src/CommunityToolkit.Maui.Maps/AppHostBuilderExtensions.shared.cs).
