# RadialGauge

This control will make data visualizations and dashboards more engaging with rich style and interactivity.
The round gauges are powerful, easy to use, and highly configurable to present dashboards capable of displaying clocks, industrial panels, automotive dashboards, and even aircraft cockpits.

The Radial Gauge supports animated transitions between configuration states. The control gradually animates as it redraws changes to the needle, needle position, scale range, color range, and more.
